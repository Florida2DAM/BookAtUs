## Description of the app

BookAtUs is a project that was thought for solving one common problem that we can find on
the schools. This problem is that the student’s books only are used for one year an then are
forgotten on a shelf for years, this is very inefficient and because of that we have created this
project.
BookAtUs is a book buying and selling app, which seeks to give a second life to those dusty
books on the shelf and captivate future readers with cheaper books.
With this App we want to create a wide and close community and a fast, safe and free service
where we can get readers to benefit from great discounts on their purchases and for sellers to
earn extra money by giving their books a second life.
